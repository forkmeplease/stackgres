## The Cluster

A StackGres cluster is basically a StatefulSet where each pod is a database instance. The
 StatefulSet guarantees that each pod is always bound to its own persistent volume. Therefore, the
 database instance data will be mapped to the state of a Patroni instance inside Kubernetes.

### StackGres Pod Architecture diagram

We use a pattern called sidecar where a main application runs in a container and other containers co-located in the same pod
 are providing side functionalities like connection pooling, export of stats, edge proxying,
 logging dispatcher or database utilities.
